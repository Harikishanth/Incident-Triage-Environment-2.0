Pure-Python grader logic and scenario definitions.

This module has ZERO external dependencies (no openenv, no FastAPI, no httpx).
This makes it instantly importable for local testing and pytest suites
without triggering the openenv framework's network bootstrapping.

The IncidentTriageEnvironment in incident_triage_env_environment.py
delegates all grading logic to this module.
